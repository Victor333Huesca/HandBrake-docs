HandBrake Documentation ![Build](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake-docs/workflows/Build/badge.svg)
=======================

HandBrake's documentation exists to provide a well researched, reasonably tested, and clearly written layperson's guide to using HandBrake.

The main focus of the project is and must always be to serve normal people using HandBrake, regardless of their technical expertise, by describing common workflows using plain language and visual guides. These docs are neither written nor designed for engineers. They are for everyone, especially non-engineer humans.

The documentation is available in two public forms:

- Published on the HandBrake website: [handbrake.fr/docs](https://handbrake.fr/docs/ "HandBrake Documentation")
- Source files on GitHub: [github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake-docs](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake-docs/ "HandBrake Documentation source files")

Most people should use the first resource, which is the official published documentation. If you want to learn how to use HandBrake, go there now! [Official HandBrake Documentation](https://handbrake.fr/docs/)
